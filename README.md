## Unit Testing

This app implements TDD through [Jasmine Unit Testing](http://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html). 
This is installed automatically when you perform the setup as shown above.

The unit testing spec file is present at [/app/unit-test.spec.js](/app/unit-test.spec.js).
All unit tests are written in this file, and are rendered by Jasmine.

To run the test, simply run `npm test`. A live-reloading browser window will open up with the unit tests.
